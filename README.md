# NeuralAmpModeler Workspace

This repository contains the JavaScript/Python implementation. C# work should live in the dedicated [NAM_CS](https://github.com/sshukes/NAM_CS) repository as requested. The previous `csharp` stub was removed to avoid confusion.

## Working on the C# repo
Create or open a separate environment/workspace that is cloned from the `NAM_CS` repository (naming it `NAM_CS` helps avoid mixing files between projects). This JavaScript/Python repo does not need an additional environment beyond its own checkout.
